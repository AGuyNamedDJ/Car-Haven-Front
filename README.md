# Car-Haven-Front

This is a car dealership website, where users can browse and learn about various luxury car manufacturers, models and their features. Built with a Node.js and Express.js backend, and a React.js frontend with Tailwind CSS for styling. The website allows users to view and filter through a catalog of cars, as well as create, read, update, and delete manufacturers, models, and car listings through a secure admin portal. The project also uses a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve data.
